			<h2>Sonification of Go Games with Space-filling Curves</h2>
			<p>Data sonification is the process of translating data into sound and music. It is getting more popular as a method of overcoming literacy, numeracy, and visualization barriers to communications. Sonifying a dataset makes data accessible to a broad audience with different levels of expertise and particularly people with visual impairments. This project designed a method to sonify Go games with space-filling curves. Go is the most challenging classical board game played by two players, which was too difficult for traditional artificial intelligence before AlphaGo. I picked Game 4 between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol (the only game AlphaGo lost) to do the sonification. A space-filling curve is a continuous curve that passes through every point in the unit square. The mapping from one-dimension to two-dimensions does a good job in preserving locality: the points close to each other in 1D are also close to each other in 2D. The Peano curve and Hilbert curve are among the most famous space-filling curves--they are defined on squares with the side length being the power of 3 and 2 respectively. The Go board is 19 by 19, which is neither power of 3 nor power of 2. I first constructed a modified Peano curve, then mapped the Go board coordinates to space-filling curve values. Ultimately, I sonified the data, transforming the Go game into music. In the future, I hope to continue exploring the intersect of different fields through the channel data science. </p>

			<h2>The Game of Go</h2>
			<p> Upon the vast Go board, infinite possibilities play out, providing the space for creativity and exploration. Throughout this journey, I've gained insights into strategic thinking and discerned recurrent themes, observing how certain patterns on the board manifest in the broader scope of life. Engaging in this game has also given me the opportunity to communicate and connect through exchange of ideas on the board, and take part in a vibrant, passionate community. </p>
